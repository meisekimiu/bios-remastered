<hr />
<p class="authorsnote">Thank you for reading <em>bio3.</em> This is the original ending screen for the first "gate" of a larger project. The second gate, <em>antimoon,</em> is linked above and was mostly written throughout 2014. Unlike the bite-sized "poetry" projects of <em>bios,</em> gate 2 features dense surrealist prose. I hope that you check it out if you somehow read through all of <em>{bios}.</em></p>
<p class="authorsnote">Thank you again for checking out {bios}. Assorted thanks for these projects go to:
  <ul>
  	<li>D. Pischke</li>
  	<li>C. Gielda</li>
  	<li>J. Jamison</li>
  	<li>Computer 31 in that library</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p class="authorsnote">In this little author's note, I will probably not explain any of the entries to keep
that feeling of surealness...</p>
<p class="authorsnote">...Okay I can't resist revealing just one secret!</p>
<p class="authorsnote">"x!.txt" from "bio" is about my math homework haha.</p>
